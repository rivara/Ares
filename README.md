## TO-DO
You need to create a web application with Laravel (the most current version available) that is
I was in charge of managing the stock of products in a store.
The application must have a Home page that will show the user the list of
products registered in the database.
This home page will in turn have a button to display a form in which
to register a new product.<br>
A product is made up of the following fields:<br>
• Name<br>
• Description<br>
• In Stock<br>
The list of products will be shown in table format, making it possible to paginate the
itself, being able to choose the number of elements that are displayed per page (give to choose
between 10, 25 and 50).
Each element shown in the table must have two action buttons, one for
edit the product, and another to remove it from stock.
At least, the actions of editing and deleting the product must be done in a
asynchronous, that is, it is not necessary to refresh the entire page to update the
table content.<br>
### Consideration
The design of the interface is of free choice, being essential that the design be
responsive and that the information is displayed in a clean and clear way.
The database will be created from scratch for MySQL.
At least, there must be a battery of 25 products already pre-established for the
Home page listing.
